# Extracting Contract Specs - Rust

This example shows how to extract contract specifications from Soroban smart
contracts using Rust.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)

## Usage

1. Navigate to this directory.

2. Run the code that loads the `contract.wasm` file and extracts its spec,
   printing out functions in the spec:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

3. View the [src/main.rs](src/main.rs) file to understand how the spec is
   extracted.
