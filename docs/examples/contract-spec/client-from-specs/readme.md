# Generating Clients from Contract Specs

This example demonstrates how to generate at runtime a client for calling the
functions of a Stellar contract in JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.com/)

## Usage

1. Navigate to this directory.

2. Run the code that creates a client and then uses it to simulate a call to a
   contract function:
   ```bash
   deno task run
   ```

3. View the [main.js](main.js) file to understand how the client is created and
   used.
